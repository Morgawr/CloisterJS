# CloisterJS

A ClojureScript framework/library for game development.

### What is CloisterJS?

CloisterJS is a framework/library for developing videogames on browsers. It makes use of the Clojure language compiled to Javascript using the ClojureScript compiler.

### What advantages does CloisterJS give?

It provides an already existing base on which the developer can improve when developing browser games. CloisterJS provides a Component-Entity-System (CES) approach to game development removing the need of deep hierarchies of data bringing a horizontal approach to interactable entities.

## The state of the project

It currently is still under heavy development, this is an early alpha release missing a lot of features yet to be implemented and tested on actual games. Please be patient and feel free to snoop around the code and participate.

### Browser support

Currently, CloisterJS only supports the latest releases Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome/Chromium. It is still under heavy development.

### Are there limits on the usage of the software?

The code is licensed under a modified version of the zlib license. The changes concern commercial applications, where it is required to show an acknowledgment to this software.
